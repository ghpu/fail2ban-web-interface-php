# Grant sudo permissions to the user to manage fail2ban-client
# Replace __USER__ with the web server user (e.g., www-data, apache, nginx)
#
# This configuration allows the following fail2ban-client commands:
# - status: View jail status and banned IPs
# - get <jail> findtime/bantime/maxretry: View jail configuration
# - get <jail> ignoreip: View whitelisted (ignored) IPs per jail
# - set <jail> banip/unbanip <ip>: Ban or unban an IP address
# - set <jail> addignoreip/delignoreip <ip>: Add or remove IP from whitelist
#
# Note: Whitelist changes via CLI are runtime-only and do not persist
# to jail.local. To make permanent whitelist changes, edit jail.local directly.
